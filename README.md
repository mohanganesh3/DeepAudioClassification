# Deep Audio Classification ðŸŽ§ðŸ”Š

The Deep Audio Classification project focuses on developing a robust audio classification model as part of the Z by HP Unlocked Challenge 3 - Signal Processing. This repository includes the implementation of the model and results obtained from the dataset provided.

# ðŸ“… Project Overview

This project aims to classify audio signals into different categories using deep learning techniques. The dataset consists of various audio clips, and the objective is to leverage these clips for effective classification.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found at:

# ðŸ§  How It Works

	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	â€¢	Loading and Resampling: Audio clips are loaded and converted to a mono channel if needed. Each clip is resampled to a standard frequency of 16 kHz for consistency across the dataset.
	â€¢	Feature Extraction: The resampled audio signals undergo feature extraction to generate spectrograms or similar representations, making the audio data compatible with deep learning models.
	2.	Model Development:
	â€¢	Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented using TensorFlow, structured with several 2D convolutional layers followed by dense layers to capture intricate audio patterns. The CNN structure is designed specifically to handle spectrogram inputs.
	â€¢	Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, suitable for binary classification. Performance metrics include precision and recall to capture model effectiveness in classifying each audio category.
	3.	Training and Evaluation:
	â€¢	Training: The model is trained on a training set split from the dataset, iterating through multiple epochs to minimize loss and improve classification accuracy.
	â€¢	Evaluation: Post-training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on a test set using metrics like precision and recall. The results, including loss and accuracy metrics across epochs, are visualized for better insight into model performance and saved in results.csv.

# ðŸ”§ Usage

	1.	Jupyter Notebook:
	â€¢	Run AudioClassification.ipynb to follow the implementation, train the model, and visualize the results.
